      Links to Third Party Websites and Advertisers
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Site contains links to other websites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. In some instances, these websites are co-branded and the third parties are entitled to use BeenVerified’s name and logo on their websites. BeenVerified does not control the information, products, or services available on or through these third party websites. The inclusion on the Site of a third-party link does not imply endorsement by BeenVerified of the applicable website or any association with the website’s operators. Because BeenVerified has no control over such websites, you agree that BeenVerified is not responsible or liable for the availability or the operation of such websites, for any material located on or available through such websites, or for the data practices of such websites, which shall be subject to those websites’ policies and terms. If you click on any third-party advertisements on the Site, participate in any promotions offered by such advertisers, or purchase any goods or services from such advertisers, any terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings or promotions are solely between you and the applicable advertiser or other third party, and you agree that BeenVerified shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage you suffer through your dealings with or based on your reliance on any material made available by such advertisers.

  <h3>
    Arbitration and Dispute Resolution
  </h3>
    <p>
    These Terms and Conditions shall be treated as though they were executed and performed in New York City, NY and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles).
    </p>
    <p>
    At BeenVerified, we expect that our customer service team will be able to resolve most complaints you may have regarding our provision or your use of the Member Services or BeenVerified Checks. If you have such a complaint, you can contact our customer service team as described in the “How to Contact Us” section below. In the unlikely event that your complaint remains unresolved, we prefer to specify now what each of us should expect in order to avoid any confusion later. Accordingly, you and BeenVerified agree to the following resolution process for all disputes and claims that you or BeenVerified have arising from our provision or your use of the Member Services or BeenVerified Checks (each a “Service Claim”).
    </p>
    <p>
    In an attempt to find the quickest and most efficient resolution of any Service Claim, you and BeenVerified agree to first discuss the Service Claim informally for at least 30 days. To do that, the party who brings the Service Claim must first send to the other party a notice that must include (1) a description of the Service Claim and (2) a proposed resolution (together, the “Claim Notice”).  If you want to raise a Service Claim, you must send your Claim Notice by certified mail to us at: BeenVerified, Attn: Legal Department, 307 5th Avenue - 16th Floor, New York, NY 10016. If we would like to subsequently discuss your Service Claim with you, we will contact you using the e-mail address or mailing address you provide in your letter to us.  If BeenVerified wants to raise a Service Claim, we will send our Claim Notice to you at the e-mail address that we have on file for you.  If we do not have an e-mail address for you on file, BeenVerified will send our Service Claim to you through a means that complies with the service of process rules of the State of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
    IF YOU AND BEENVERIFIED DO NOT REACH AN AGREED UPON RESOLUTION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE SERVICE CLAIM, YOU AND BEENVERIFIED AGREE THAT THE SERVICE CLAIM MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION USING ITS CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES, AVAILABLE HERE.
    </p>
    <p>
    AS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT, EITHER PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO (1) PURSUE A SERVICE CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OF APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION, OR (2) PURSUE AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM OR CLAIM RELATING TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO DATA THROUGH THE SITE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND TRADE SECRETS, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO THE ACCESS OR RETRIEVAL OF DATA THROUGH THE SITE USING AN AUTOMATED PROCESS SUCH AS SCRAPING) IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NY. BOTH BEENVERIFIED AND YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS FOR THESE CLAIMS.
    </p>
    <p>
    NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE ANY PARTY FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NY IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS PENDING AN OUTCOME IN ARBITRATION.
    </p>
    <p>
    TO HELP RESOLVE ANY ISSUES BETWEEN US PROMPTLY AND DIRECTLY, YOU AND BEENVERIFIED AGREE TO BEGIN ANY ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS ALLOWED UNDER THIS SECTION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.
    </p>
    <p>
    YOU AND BEENVERIFIED ALSO AGREE TO ARBITRATE IN EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY, NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS, AND EACH OF US EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.
    </p>
    <p>
    Rather than force everyone to visit us in New York, if you can demonstrate to us that arbitration in New York would create an undue burden to you, we will allow you to initiate the arbitration in your home state. Otherwise, the arbitration hearings will be held in New York, NY.  Any disagreements regarding the forum for arbitration will be settled by the arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the 30-day period described above has elapsed, you may initiate the arbitration through the process described in the AAA’s Consumer Rules. If you initiate the arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules. Regardless of who initiates the arbitration, BeenVerified will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
    IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BOTH YOU AND BEENVERIFIED ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY FOR SERVICE CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS “ARBITRATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION.  THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the arbitrator rules against BeenVerified, in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, we think it’s fair that BeenVerified reimburse your reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the arbitration.  In addition, if the arbitrator rules in BeenVerified’s favor, we will not seek reimbursement of our attorneys’ fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you're not sure what all of this means, of course please feel free to ask an attorney.
    </p>

      Waiver
    </h3>

      BeenVerified’s failure to enforce a breach of or insist upon strict adherence to any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of BeenVerified’s right to enforce breaches of or insist upon strict adherence to such provision or any other provision of these Terms and Conditions.
