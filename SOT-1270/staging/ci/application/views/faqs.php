                A privacy-friendly public record search engine doesn't need to be an oxymoron. Whether you&#39;re concerned about the information you provide to BeenVerifeid or searches you conduct, or you&#39;re curious about what public information on yourself might turn up, BeenVerified always respects your privacy. BeenVerified&#39;s full privacy practices are contained in our <a href="/privacy/">privacy policy</a>, but this FAQ will give you an idea of how we treat your information.  If this FAQ does not answer all of your questions, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@public-records.net?subject=Public-Records.net Support">privacy@public-records.net.</a>

                <p class="h4"><strong>How Does BeenVerified Use Information it Collects When I Sign Up?</strong></p>
                <p>BeenVerified uses the information you submit during the registration process to manage your relationship with BeenVerified. For example, we use your email address to provide you with information about your BeenVerified account, product updates, and general information about BeenVerified. We do not, under any circumstances, use your account information as part of our search results nor do we sell your information to third party providers of public record information.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="h4"><strong>What Can I Use BeenVerified For?</strong></p>
                <p>There are countless ways you can use BeenVerified. This includes checking out people you meet on online dating websites, trying to locate old friends, and learning more about those in you or your family members' lives. You can also use BeenVerified to see what information is out there on yourself. You can use BeenVerified to find out who called your phone, to research property, or find a person&#39;s public social networking profiles.</p>
                <p>What you can&#39;t do is use BeenVerified to determine a person&#39;s eligibility or suitability for employment, insurance, credit, loans, education, housing, or other similar purposes.  Using BeenVerified information in these ways violates both our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a> and the law, and can lead to possible criminal penalties.  We take this very seriously, and reserve the right to terminate user accounts and/or report violators to law enforcement as appropriate.</p>
                <p>We encourage you to review our complete <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a>, which provide the final say on how you can use information from BeenVerified, or to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@public-records.net?subject=Public-Records.net Support">privacy@public-records.net</a>.</p>

                <p class="h4"><strong>Need to Opt-Out? We Make it Easy</strong></p>
                <p>If you see your information in our people search results, and don&#39;t want it to show up any more, no problem.  BeenVerified offers you the ability to remove this information from our people search results by contacting our <a href="/contact/">customer support</a>.

                <br>
                <p class="h4"><strong>Can I Search People from Other Countries?</strong></p>

                <br>
                <p class="h4"><strong>Is Anyone Notified I Am Searching for Them?</strong></p>
                <p>All of BeenVerified reports are confidential. The person you are searching for is not notified.</p>
