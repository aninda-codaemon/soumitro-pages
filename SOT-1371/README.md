## Hidden Inputs

configure the form by adding values to the following hidden fields inside the form element:

```
<input type="hidden" name="offer_id" value="xxx" />
<input type="hidden" name="aff_id" value="xxxx" />
<input type="hidden" name="file_id" value="xxx" />
```

## Media Queries

The css has media queries to account for different device widths. You need to make sure to add a meta tag to your head so that the banners are responsive in the browser:


```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
